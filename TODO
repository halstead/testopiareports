- have an eye on TR_Colors: decouple the colors from the actual name of the values delivered by the SQL query
- filter for reports (fields and expressions)
- freestyle report
- new report "Top Bugs" (This report displays the bugs found in test cases within the test plan ordered by the bugs attached
	to the most test cases. In other words, which bugs are failing the most test cases.)
- new report "Estimated vs Actual Time" Test cases can have a time estimate associated with them. This can then be used in conjunction 
	with the case-runs for that case to determine the actual running time. To do this, test case-runs
	must be placed in the RUNNING state when a test is started. This then starts the stopwatch so to
	speak for that case in that run. When a case is passed or failed the difference of the two times is
	calculated. The average of all case-runs in all runs for this case is then used to calculate this
	report.
- new report (or different view):list of all test cases in one run with number of bugs attached
- show/hide for data table and charts (maybe no button but a small symbol)
- csv export
- change all SQLs to SQL objects (this could be also used to get technical table and field name for translating them)
