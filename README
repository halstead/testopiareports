To apply this patch, replace the original files inside /mediawiki*/extensions/TestopiaReports/ with the files in this archive. Please make backups to be safe.

To finish fixing the Agenda report type, comment out the graphviz line inside LocalSettings.php and remove the comma behind the previous line like so:

$wgTestopiaReports = array(
 'host'        => "localhost",.
 'database'    => "bugzilla",
 'user'        => "bugzilla",
 'password'    => "somepassword",
 'bzserver'    => "http://localhost/bugzilla",
 'chartdevice' => "google"
# 'graphviz'    => "/usr/bin/dot"
);


That should do it!
