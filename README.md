Like the extension Bugzilla Reports this extension is aiming for integrating reports from Bugzilla addon Testopia. Furthemore is it able to produce charts using the Google Chart API. The reports are providing links through to Bugzilla and Testopia.

Due to its modular setup it should be easy to add additional reports.

Currently the following reports are included with more to come:

    Test Case Status Report per test run
    Priority Breakdown Report per test run
    Bug Status Report per test run
    Test plan and test cases
    Agenda - a report creating an agenda from the test cases inclueded in a test run using the dependencies

This repository adds support for newer versions of Bugzilla.
